<p>
<h4>Documentation of the Development Process</h4> <br>
<h5 class="about-doc-process">The web site is done for fictional uncle, who has requested help in developing a website for his small business.
The website structure I chose to use is the hierarchies. Hierarchical structure planned around a home page. 
The home page use as the core navigation location. All the other pages have a link through the home page and in reverse as well.  
Other pages organize as a tree structure or multi-tiered. Home page navigation bar with all other sub-categories include Tea, Teaware, about us, FAQ and contact us as sub-categories.
This structure is easier to navigate for the users so they could find the products easier.</p></h5>

<h5 class="about-doc-process"><p>Green is a primary color, most of the time colors could spark website usersâ€™ feelings. The secondary highlight color use is red for any important features to catch the eye of the user. Saturation of green use in where it is necessary. Description and other information, text planned to use darker or lighter grey and background color could use beige, white, or off-white. Most of the color choices are simpler and neutral. </p></h5>
<p>
<h5 class="about-doc-process">The typography text on the website is Arial (san serif). The reason to use this font because it is the font widely used in many websites. Arial font type use in all pages include sub-category pages.  All the webpage headlines, headings, and body (descriptions, information) use as Arial (san serif). This font type is easier to read and plans to keep consistency throughout the website. Use the bigger font sizes for the headlines than the body (description) area.</p></h5>
